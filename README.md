# Arduino Sensor Plotter
This is code to read in sensor information from the serial of an Arduino.
## Setup
- Install Python 3 (ideally 3.9 because this project was tested with 3.9).
- Create a virtual environment.
- Install libraries: matplotlib, notebook, serial

**Create Virtual Environment**

`python3 -m venv .venv`


**Install Libraries**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the jupyter notebook, it is easy to do in VSCode. Change the necessary port and baud rate.

## Credits
I obtained this code from [this](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/11-Python-and-External-Hardware/11.04-Reading-a-Sensor-with-Python.html) article.
